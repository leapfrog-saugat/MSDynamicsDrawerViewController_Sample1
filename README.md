# MSDynamicsDrawerViewController_Sample1
#Introduction
This sample project uses [MSDynamicsDrawerViewController](https://github.com/erichoracek/MSDynamicsDrawerViewController) for a simple scenario. 
>MSDynamicsDrawerViewController is a container view controller that manages the presentation of a single "pane" view controller overlaid over one or two "drawer" view controllers. The drawer view controllers are hidden by default, but can be exposed by a user-initiated swipe in the direction that that drawer view controller is hidden in. It uses UIKit Dynamics for all animationâ€”there's not a single call to animateWithDuration:animations: in the project.

##Scenario
You have a project in which you want to show the side menu on swipe gesture towards left. But you also have a login screen in your project where this side menu should not be visible. You also don't want to enable this side menu on a view controller, if this view controller was navigated from a Navigation View Controller.

#Usage
This project is just an example to show the use of MSDynamicsDrawerViewController for a particular scenario. But it can be easily modified for other projects as well.

#Installation
Simply install this project with any method you find comfortable. No extra things to install

#Note
This project runs just fine. But some clean ups are necessary on the code. I will continue updating this project as soon as I can scrape some free time from my schedule. Comments are appreciated.
